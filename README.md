# Dashboard-VanArsdel
The creation of a PowerBI sales dashboard for VanArsdel, covering the period from 2012 to 2019

VanArsdel Company is a manufacturing company with many competing rivals. Despite leading the market in its production field, the company aims to increase its market share and explore opportunities for production development.

The company needs to understand the business situation of its main competing rivals in order to develop a suitable business strategy. The company needs to have a clear understanding of its core business lines in order to enhance production.

Due to the heavy size of the file, I only upload a picture of the dashboard.
